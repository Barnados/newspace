			<!-- Project Description -->
<div class="project_description">

				 <p style="font-weight: bold;">So what about AOL users? Can you tell me more about 711391? How did her (is it her?) story become the central part of <a href="http://cannotsleepwithsnoringhusband.online" target="_blank">http://cannotsleepwithsnoringhusband.online</a>?</p><br>
				 <p style="font-style: italic;">When scrolling through all the search logs of a certain user, you find that most of them are highly narrative, which is fascinating. What makes user 711391 so special, in my opinion, is the way she uses the search engine in general: in most cases, she doesn't even seem to seek answers, she's just typing down the things troubling her, like writing in a journal or talking to a good friend or even God. She frequently reassures herself about the things she's doing, about to do, or the things she dreams of, which makes the insight into her life and mind even deeper. Take her first search, for example: "can not sleep with snoring husband," entered at 1:24am. At that time most of us would have moved to the couch rather than turn on the computer and begin typing our hearts out. The three months in which the data was captured are enough to turn the life of user 711391 upside down: we can basically follow her meeting someone online, having an affair, having a â€œbad experience meeting cyber lover," "cutting ties with person you had an affair with," and falling into a period of inner confusion and depression afterward.</p>
